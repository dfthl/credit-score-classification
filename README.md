# credit-score-classification
This is my first portfolio data science. This project is about making various kinds of machine learning that is suitable for use by dataset that can predict credit score. I got the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification/data)

Overall Steps:

* Load the Dataset
* Data Preparation
  * Removing redundant feature
  * Numeric Feature handling
  * Age Feature handling
  * String handling
  * Payment Behaviour handling
  * Credit History Age handling
  * Duplicate value handling
  * Missing value handling
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Modelling Classification ML algorithms with RandomSearch (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost)
  * Outlier handling
  * Encode categorical feature
  * Multicollinearity handling
  * Split Xtrain and Xtest into different categories
  * Standar Scaller
  * Confussion Matrix

Thank You.
